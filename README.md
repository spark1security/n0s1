# n0s1 - Secret Scanner
n0s1 ([pronunciation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nosy#Pronunciation)) is a secret scanner for Slack, Jira, Confluence, Asana, Wrike, Linear and Zendesk. It scans all channels/tickets/items/issues within the chosen platform in search of any leaked secrets in the titles, bodies, messages and comments. It is open-source and it can be easily extended to support scanning many others ticketing and messaging platforms.

These secrets are identified by comparing them against an adaptable configuration file named [regex.yaml](https://github.com/spark1security/n0s1/blob/main/src/n0s1/config/regex.yaml). Alternative TOML format is also supported: [regex.toml](https://github.com/spark1security/n0s1/blob/main/src/n0s1/config/regex.toml). The scanner specifically looks for sensitive information, which includes:
* Github Personal Access Tokens
* GitLab Personal Access Tokens
* AWS Access Tokens
* PKCS8 private keys
* RSA private keys
* SSH private keys
* npm access tokens

### Currently supported target platforms:
* [Slack](https://slack.com)
* [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)
* [Asana](https://asana.com)
* [Wrike](https://www.wrike.com)
* [Linear](https://linear.app/)
* [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/)
